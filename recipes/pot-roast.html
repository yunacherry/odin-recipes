    <h3>A Southern Classic</h3>

    <p>Many southerners would agree that there's no better comfort food than a Pot Roast that has been slow cooked for 8 or so hours until its perfectly fork tender. And when paired with mashed potatoes, and a side of oven-roasted carrots or broccoli, the dish instantly becomes a match made in heaven. And what's more, it's preparation is quite simple since you can make it in your slow cooker, pressure cooker, or even in your oven.</p>

    <p>For a dish like Pot Roast it's best to cook it low and slow, preferably in an oven or slow cooker. The roast is braised -- a technique where a protein or vegetables are first cooked with dry heat, then wet heat in a vessel, usually a covered pot with a tight lid, to keep all the moisture in and bread the food down. So it needs a piece of beef that can stand up to that whereas other cuts if cooked for a long time can become overcooked. This is why Chuck Roast is a popular choice to use when making Pot Roast. It's a tough cut from the shoulder of the cow hence why it gets worked out a lot, making it full of connective tissue that marbles into the muscle along with fat. But this also makes it the perfect cut to stand up to a long cook time because all the connective tissue breaks down, so the meat becomes tender and the fat makes for a juicy and flavorful roast.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3 lbs boneless beef chuck roast</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/c cup pinot noir or red wine of your choice</li>
        <li>2 medium yellow onions, sliced</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tsp fresh thyme leaves or 1 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>2 tsp worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>4 medium carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>3 celery ribs, washed and chopped</li>
        <li>8 oz cremini mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 cups low sodium beef broth</li>
        <li>4 tbsp salted butter, softened (optional)</li>
        <li>4 tbsp all purpose flour(optional)</li>
        <li>mashed potatoes (for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in your dutch oven on the stovetop over medium high heat. Preheat your oven to 325Â°F.</li>
        <li>Dry your roast on both sides with paper towels, then season it with salt and pepper generously on both sides. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the chuck roast into the oil and sear for 3-4 minutes, or until the roast has a good brown crust. Flip and repeat on the other side, then set the roast aside on a plate.</li>
        <li>Add the red wine to the pot, using a wooden spoon to scrape the brown fond from the bottom of the pot. Add in the tomato paste and worcestershire sauce making sure to stir well before adding the garlic, thyme, and half of the onions at the bottom of the pot. This will be our gravy later.</li>
        <li>Add the roast back to the pot and cover it in the rest of the onions, carrots, celery, and beef broth. Put the lid on the pot and place it into the preheated oven for 2.5 hours.</li>
        <li>After the 2.5 hours have passed, take the pot out of the oven, place on your stove, and remove the roast along with the vegetables and set them aside on a plate. <strong>The next steps are optional, to make the jus into a gravy. You can serve from this step.</strong></li>
        <li>Turn the stovetop heat to medium and begin to simmer the jus left in the pot. While it's coming to a simmer, make your beurre manie. Use a fork to mash the softened butter and flour together in a small mixing bowl until very well combined with no flour showing at all.</li>
        <li>When the jus begins to simmer, use a whisk to mix the beurre manie into the hot liquid. Whisk until its fully dissolved and the jus becomes glossy.</li>
        <li>Let the gravy simmer for another 3 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure nothing on the bottom sticks. Serve the gravy over the pot roast and mashed potatoes, or whatever side dish you serve your southern pot roast with, and Enjoy!</li>
