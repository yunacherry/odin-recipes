    <h3>A Southern Classic</h3>

    <p>Many southerners would agree that there's no better comfort food than a Pot Roast that has been slow cooked for 8 or so hours until its perfectly fork tender. And when paired with mashed potatoes, and a side of oven-roasted carrots or broccoli, the dish instantly becomes a match made in heaven. And what's more, it's preparation is quite simple since you can make it in your slow cooker, pressure cooker, or even in your oven.</p>

    <p>For a dish like Pot Roast it's best to cook it low and slow, preferably in an oven or slow cooker. The roast is braised -- a technique where a protein or vegetables are first cooked with dry heat, then wet heat in a vessel, usually a covered pot with a tight lid, to keep all the moisture in and bread the food down. So it needs a piece of beef that can stand up to that whereas other cuts if cooked for a long time can become overcooked. This is why Chuck Roast is a popular choice to use when making Pot Roast. It's a tough cut from the shoulder of the cow hence why it gets worked out a lot, making it full of connective tissue that marbles into the muscle along with fat. But this also makes it the perfect cut to stand up to a long cook time because all the connective tissue breaks down, so the meat becomes tender and the fat makes for a juicy and flavorful roast.</p>
