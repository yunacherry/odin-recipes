    <h3>A Comfort Food from Mexico</h3>

    <p>Enchiladas Suizas is a popular Mexican dish made by stuffing corn tortillas with shredded chicken,  bathed with a creamy verde sauce, topped with a generous amount of cheese that is then baked until the cheese is melted. </p>
    
    <p>The comfort food is a twist on the recipe of traditional enchiladas made with red or green sauce. The name "Suiza" translates to Swiss. So Enchilada Suiza means Swiss-style enchiladas. They were popularised by Grupo Sanborns and to this day, they are well known all over the country. The difference between regular green enchiladas and enchiladas suizas is mainly in the sauce. The creamy Suiza sauce is made with tomatillos, onions, cilantro, green chiles, and Mexican crema. Some variations also include cream cheese for even more creaminess.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <h4>For the Sauce</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Place tomatillos or tomatillo sauce in a blender</li>
        <li>Add onion, jalapeno/serrano, cilantro, garlic, crema, and chicken stock. Blend until smooth</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a pan over medium heat. Pour in the sauce, season with salt and pepper to taste, stir and let it cook until it thickens (takes about 2 minutes). Turn off the heat and set aside.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>For the Enchiladas</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>In a frying pan, heat some oil over medium heat. Fry tortillas just until softened, about 5 seconds each side.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process one tortilla at a time then place them on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil. Set aside and let them cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Add about 1 cup of the sauce to the shredded chicken and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add 2-3 tbsps of shredded chicken in the middle of the fried tortillas and roll them up like burritos. Repeat the process until all chicken and tortillas are gone.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a baking dish. Pour half the sauce in the dish and spread it evenly.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken filled tortillas on the baking dish, making sure the seam side is down.</li>
        <li>Pour the remaining sauce over the enchiladas, spreading it all evenly. Then add the shredded cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and bake for about 20 minutes or just until the cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately either on its own or garnish with jalapeno, cilantro, onion, more cheese, or more crema. And Enjoy!</li>
