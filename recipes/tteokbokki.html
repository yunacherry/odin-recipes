        <h3>A popular Korean street food originally found by accident has become a dish recognised and enjoyed worldwide.</h3>

        <p>Tteokbokki (pronounced like "tok-poh-kee") is a popular Korean staple often best enjoyed straight from the pot while it's still warm. It consists of small-sized garae-tteok (long, white, cylinder-shaped rice cakes) called tteokmyeon, simmered in a spicy broth that gives it a beautiful crimson hue. With the culmination of new recipes, the spicy rice cakes become a delicious base as it's also common to add veggies such as onions and cabbage along with eomuk (known as fish cakes, which are a mixture of ground white fish mixed with starch, vegetables like carrots or onions and various seasonings shaped into rectangles, then steamed or fried).</p>
