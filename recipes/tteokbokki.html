        <h3>A Savory Sensation</h3>

        <p>Tteokbokki (pronounced like "tok-poh-kee") is a popular Korean staple often best enjoyed straight from the pot while it's still warm. It consists of small-sized garae-tteok (long, white, cylinder-shaped rice cakes) called tteokmyeon, simmered in a spicy broth that gives it a beautiful crimson hue. With the culmination of new recipes for the spicy rice cakes it's also become common to add veggies such as onions and cabbage along with eomuk (known as fish cakes, which are a mixture of ground white fish mixed with starch, vegetables like carrots or onions and various seasonings shaped into rectangles, then steamed or fried). This is seen to be a common base for many tteokbokki recipes, as there are various forms of the classic dish. Some popular versions are Cheese Tteokbokki, Jajang Tteokbokki, Haemul Tteokbokki, Rabokki, and Rose Tteokbokki.</p>

        <p>The popular dish has a long history in Korea as it contains traces from the royal palace. The origin of the rice cakes comes from the royal kitchen and they were considered a part of luxury, haute Korean cuisine. There's a well known story about a woman named Ma Bok-lim, who ran a small restaurant in Seoul. She's credited as the creator of the beloved dish because she found it by accidentally dropping rice cakes into a pepper paste at her restaurant which then lead to the discovery of Tteokbokki. Her version is Gungjung Tteokbokki which is a non-spicy version of the dish, flavored with soy sauce. It showcases the original style of tteokbokki served in the Joseon Dynasty. In Seoul, her restaurant has a whole street block reserved where you can see her humor shine through with a quote written on the overhead sign that reads "Even my daughter-in-law doesn't know" where you can still enjoy her version of Tteokbokki today.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 lb rice cakes, fresh or frozen (use a little more if you're not adding hard boiled eggs and fish cakes)</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>7 large dried anchovies, with head and intestines removed</li>
            <li>6 x 8 inches dried kelp</li>
            <li>1/3 cup hot pepper paste (gochujang)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp korean hot pepper flakes (gochugaru)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>3 green onions, cut into 3 inch long pieces</li>
            <li>2 hard boiled eggs (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 fish cakes (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Add the water, dried anchovies, and dried kelp to a shallow pot or pan.</li>
            <li>Boil for 15 minutes over medium high heat without the lid.</li>
            <li>Combine gochujang (hot pepper paste), gochugaru (hot pepper flakes), and sugar in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Remove the anchovies and kelp from the pot and add the rice cakes, the spicy pepper mix from the bowl, green onions, as well as the optional fish cakes and hard boiled eggs.</li>
            <li>When it starts to boil, stir gently. Let it simmer and keep stirring it until the rice cakes turn soft and the sauce thickens and looks shiny. It should take about 10-15 minutes. If the rice cake is not soft enough in that time, add more water and continue stirring until it softens. Freshly made rice cakes will soften faster so if you're using frozen rice cakes, thaw them out and soak them in cold water first, to soften them before adding them to the pan.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat, serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
