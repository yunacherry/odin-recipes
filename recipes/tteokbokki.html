        <h3>A popular Korean street food originally found by accident has become a dish recognised and enjoyed worldwide.</h3>

        <p>Tteokbokki (pronounced like "tok-poh-kee") is a popular Korean staple often best enjoyed straight from the pot while it's still warm. It consists of small-sized garae-tteok (long, white, cylinder-shaped rice cakes) called tteokmyeon, simmered in a spicy broth that gives it a beautiful crimson hue. With the culmination of new recipes for the spicy rice cakes it's also become common to add veggies such as onions and cabbage along with eomuk (known as fish cakes, which are a mixture of ground white fish mixed with starch, vegetables like carrots or onions and various seasonings shaped into rectangles, then steamed or fried). This is seen to be a common base for many tteokbokki recipes, as there are various forms of the classic dish. Some popular versions are Cheese Tteokbokki, Jajang Tteokbokki, Haemul Tteokbokki, Rabokki, and Rose Tteokbokki.</p>

        <p>The popular dish has a long history in Korea as it contains traces from the royal palace. The origin of the rice cakes comes from the royal kitchen and they were considered a part of luxury, haute Korean cuisine. There's a well known story about a woman named Ma Bok-lim, who ran a small restaurant in Seoul. She's credited as the creator of the beloved dish because she found it by accidentally dropping rice cakes into a pepper paste at her restaurant which then lead to the discovery of Tteokbokki. Her version is Gungjung Tteokbokki which is a non-spicy version of the dish, flavored with soy sauce. It showcases the original style of tteokbokki served in the Joseon Dynasty. In Seoul, her restaurant has a whole street block reserved where you can see her humor shine through with a quote written on the overhead sign that reads "Even my daughter-in-law doesn't know" where you can still enjoy her version of Tteokbokki today.</p>
